Android Conference App GuideBy Peter Ma, Catch.comIntroductionCatch.com makes it easy to capture your ideas and experiences into activity streams in those areas where you want to learn and grow. Capturing notes during a conference is an ideal use case for Catch.After the release of several successful apps for TED and TEDx conferences that integrated the Catch functionality, it was decided to open source the app and make it available to any conference organizer for free. The functionality was further improved and syncing now uses Google Fusion Table to avoid relying on private databases. Any event organizer who wants to have an iphone app for their conference can simply follow this guide. The app is open sourced under the terms of the MIT license and Apache License and can be found at https://github.com/catch/TED-Android-App. Contributions are welcome.The conference app currently supports single-track conferences. Conferences with multiple tracks are supported by having several single-track buttons on the dashboard. This portion will be improved in the future.
